Workflow

buffer farmland to 200m 

use unsupervised image classification to classify pixels

use pixels of identified SWI to identify class of candidate SWI areas

export polygons of candidate SWI areas for visual inspection

hand edit polygon areas to identify correct polygons

reclassify polygons of candidate SWI areas as true or not true SWI areas

(this is still a subset of the whole farmland area)

use training data (true classifications of SWI areas) in supervised classification

assess accuracy of supervised classification

estimate area using polygons in correct coordinate reference system
